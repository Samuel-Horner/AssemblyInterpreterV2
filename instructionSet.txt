
VAL <operand1> Stores a value
LDR Rd, <memory ref> Load the value stored in the memory location
	specified by <memory ref> into register d.
STR Rd, <memory ref> Store the value that is in register d into the
	memory location specified by <memory ref>.
ADD Rd, Rn, <operand2> Add the value specified in <operand2> to the
	value in register n and store the result in register d.
SUB Rd, Rn, <operand2> Subtract the value specified by <operand2>
	from the value in register n and store the result
	in register d.
MOV Rd, <operand2> Copy the value specified by <operand2> into
	register d.
CMP Rn, <operand2> Compare the value stored in register n with the
	value specified by <operand2>.
B <label> Always branch to the instruction at position
	<label> in the program.
B<condition> <label> Branch to the instruction at position <label> if
	the last comparison met the criterion specified
	by <condition>. Possible values for
	<condition> and their meanings are:
		EQ: equal to NE: not equal to
		GT: greater than LT: less than
AND Rd, Rn, <operand2> Perform a bitwise logical AND operation
	between the value in register n and the value
	specified by <operand2> and store the result in
	register d.
ORR Rd, Rn, <operand2> Perform a bitwise logical OR operation between
	the value in register n and the value specified by
	<operand2> and store the result in register d.
EOR Rd, Rn, <operand2> Perform a bitwise logical XOR (exclusive or)
	operation between the value in register n and
	the value specified by <operand2> and store
	the result in register d.
MVN Rd, <operand2> Perform a bitwise logical NOT operation on the
	value specified by <operand2> and store the
	result in register d.
LSL Rd, Rn, <operand2> Logically shift left the value stored in register n
	by the number of bits specified by <operand2>
	and store the result in register d.
LSR Rd, Rn, <operand2> Logically shift right the value stored in register n
	by the number of bits specified by <operand2>
	and store the result in register d.
HALT Stops the execution of the program.
